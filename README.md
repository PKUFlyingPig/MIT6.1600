## Feedback & Contributions

This is still a new class, and we are always working to improve the labs. If you find things that are annoying or that make it hard for you to effectively complete the labs and learn from them, please let us know. If you'd like to open a PR, feel free, but it probably be worthwhile to check with us before doing so to discuss your improvement.

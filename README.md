# MIT6.1600: Foundations of Computer Security

MIT6.1600 is an undergraduate class at MIT that broadly focused on computer security that covers the foundations of secure systems and cryptography. It focuses on basic principles of designing secure systems with critical cryptographic components and the integration of these components into said systems. 6.1600 will allow undergraduates to enter the important field of computer security earlier in their undergraduate program and also serve as an entry point for the graduate offeringsâ€”6.5610 [6.857], 6.5660 [6.858], and 6.5620 [6.875], which focus on applied cryptography, systems security, and theoretical cryptography, respectively.

This repo contains the learning materials that I used to self-learn this great course and my solutions to the labs. There are 5 labs in total. You can find the skeleton code [here](https://github.com/mit-pdos/6.1600-labs) and refer to my solution [here](./labs/). Some other useful resources are listed below:

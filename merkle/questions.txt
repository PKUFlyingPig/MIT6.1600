Warm-Up Excercises:

A) Subsequent client lookups (get operations) will fail. The client will know that the server 
restarted if the root hash of the Merkle tree it holds doesn't match the root hash from the server.

B) The client cannot be certain that the server it is communicating with is the same as before (or even a legitimate server)
 as the Merkle tree has been reset. Trust needs to be re-established. If put operations didn't fail,
 the client might end up updating a key-value pair on a server that it shouldn't trust, which could 
 lead to data corruption or unauthorized data access.

C) The length of the proof is 9. The first 8 bits of the hash of "hello" and "foo" are the same. So after
 inserting hello=world and foo=bar, the depth of the merkel tree is 9. The merkle proof contains the siblings
 all the way from the leaf to the root, so the length of the proof is 9.

Attack 1:

A) H_kv is computed as the hash of the concatenation of key and value. So hash(hello=world) == hash(hellow=orld).
We can reset the store and then insert hellow=orld. 


Attack 2:

A)


Attack 3:

A)


Attack 4 (Optional/Extra Credit):

A)

Security Definition:

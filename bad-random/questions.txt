Problem 1:

B) 32 bytes and 64 bytes, but 64 bytes will not add more security because the adversary can directly guess the 32 bytes secret key.

Problem 2:

A) alpha_t = (s1 - s2)^-1 * (Hm1 - Hm2) (mod q), then alpha = (s1 * alpha_t - Hm1) * r1^-1 (mod q)

C) The signing nonce is sampled from {1, 2, ..., 2^128}, due to birthday paradox, after an attacker obtains 2^64 signatures, there exists two signatures that signed with the same signing nonce with constant probability. From B), we can recover the secret key from the two signatures.

Problem 3:

A)
